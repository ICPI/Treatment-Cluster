This folder contains the R Script and excel template *(data not included)* for the proposed analysis. These products include: 
1. Table 1: Site Reporting Characteristics
    1. Data aggregated at the PSNU level
    1. Includes calculated indicators: SITE_DROP, SITE_ADD, SITE_NOCHANGE, SITE_1X-SITE_3X (and related TX_CURR values)
1. Table 2: Site Mech Changes
    1. Data at site by IM level (i.e. lower than site level)
    1. DRAFT: _**IN PROGRESS PER CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER GROUPS WORKING ON MECH CHANGE ISSUES**_
1. Table 3: List of non-reporting sites
    1. Data at site/facility level
    1. NOTE: Reporting period is period at which site dropped off/reported no data; TX_CURR is the value of reported last (i.e. TX_CURR_P)
